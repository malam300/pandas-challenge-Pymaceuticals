Analysis; I forgot to add it onto original Pandas file so I'm adding to a read me file
While the effectiveness of Capomulin seems to be comparable to Ramicane, it is significantly more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamine (based on the box plots of the final tumor volumes)
The heavier the mouse, the less effective the drug is (see scatter plot). This is a reliable conclusion because of the strong r-value correlation (0.84) resulting from the linear regression.
The results of the study are very consistent, thus reliable, as there is only 1 outlier in the data set for the top drugs, and none for Capomulin
